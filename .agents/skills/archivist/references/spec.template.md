<!--
Template for services/<service>/deltas/<slice>.spec.md — the living, current
contract for one project slice/capability's LOGIC layer (data, rules,
invariants). A slice with a UI-facing surface has a presentation-layer
counterpart, <slice>.design.md (own template, references/design.template.md)
— don't fold layout/states/interactions in here, and don't duplicate an
invariant stated here inside that file either; it should reference this one.
Edited in place as the slice evolves — this file is always the current
truth, not a log of how it got there. No append-only history is kept
alongside it; if a decision needs theory/context beyond what the contract
shape below holds, that goes in the optional Context section at the end
(free-form, no fixed skeleton), never in a decision-log entry.
Fill every section; delete guidance comments before presenting the draft.
Ground every claim in the actual source implementing the slice — never write
this from memory, from a description alone, or from an older doc's claim.

# <Slice name> — Spec

> <One line: what this slice is responsible for.>

## Intent

<!-- Why this slice exists, in the domain's own vocabulary — not an implementation summary. -->

## Scope

<!-- What this slice owns. Then explicit non-goals — a boundary that's easy to violate by accident earns a line here. -->

## Contract

<!--
The concrete shape a caller/reader can rely on: what's configured/enabled and
why, inputs/outputs, behavior guarantees. Prefer a table or fenced code block
over prose wherever the shape is structural (config keys, request/response
fields, a permission matrix).
-->

## Invariants

<!-- What must always hold regardless of implementation changes — the things a future change to this slice must never break. This is usually the highest-value section: it's what actually gets checked later. -->

## Deferred / Open questions

<!-- Decisions intentionally not made yet, and what would trigger making them. An honest open question is a valid entry — don't force a premature decision just to fill this section. -->

## Acceptance criteria

<!-- How to verify this spec is satisfied: specific tests, or a concrete manual check, or both. If this can't be falsified by reading the resulting code/behavior, it isn't specific enough yet. -->

## Context (optional)

<!--
Omit this section entirely for the common case. Include it only when the
slice needs domain background or mechanism explanation that doesn't fit any
section above — free-form (a table here, a diagram there, a couple of
paragraphs), not a fixed skeleton like the rest of this file. Never a
decision log ("we changed X because Y", superseded-decision narratives,
timestamps) — fold decision-shaped content into the sections above as
current state instead, or leave it out.
